                                    </span>Prafull Billore or more famously known as the MBA Chaiwala these days is the successful owner of his venture named as MBA Chaiwala franchise. The MBA Chaiwala business was started with Rs 8,000 investment only and is now essentially a Rs 3 crore business which is built on something that we Indians all love, i.e. tea. 

                                        Born on January 14, 1996, Prafull Billore who hails from Madhya Pradesh had completed his graduation in commerce. After completing his graduation, he was earning a salary of Rs. 25,000 a month as an Amway Salesman. Just like every other student and MBA aspirant in India, he dreamt of going to the prestigious IIM Ahmedabad to pursue his MBA. He was quite attracted to the fact the MBA graduates would receive a plethora of job offers and handsome salary packages from reputed companies and firms. Hence, he was quite keen on passing the CAT exam and securing a seat in IIM. His parents were also eager for their son to get into the esteemed management institution</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Beginning of MBA Chaiwala

Luckily for Prafull Billore, MBA Chaiwala took off well, despite an unsteady beginning. His experience of working under Mcdonald’s paid off since he was able to attract several customers to his stall by either personally approaching them or conversing with them in English. Most of his customers were impressed by his fluency in English and appreciated his friendly conversations. However, while his small business was taking off, his family was still unaware of his new venture. 

To make MBA Chaiwala more attractive and appealing to the crowd, he served his tea in earthen cups along with toast and tissue, instead of using plastic cups. He sold the tea-toast-tissue combo at a price of just Rs. 30. Within one month, he had begun selling 10,000 to 11,000 cups a day and his business was slowly growing, all the while his family remained unaware of his success. Later, his parents found his successful venture on Youtube. While not warming up to the idea of setting his tea stall, his family gradually accepted his new venture. 

So while MBA Chaiwala started to gain a good customer base, his fellow competitors were enraged at his success. The tea vendors in his locality had started to grow jealous of the growing popularity of MBA Chaiwala. The tea vendors decided to unanimously and brutally throw the MBA Chaiwala out of their area.

                                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Delhi on chokehold:</span> Delhi is in pollution’s ever tightening chokehold, causing catastrophic health harms. India ranks as the second most populated country in the world, and the first in air pollution. Of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) top 10 most polluted cities, all but one (Bamenda, Cameroon) are in India. Consider the sheer number of people breathing toxic air..</p>
                                    <p>
                                        On November 1, 2019, Delhi’s Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) declared air pollution a public health emergency. The declaration acknowledged the severe impact of pollution on health. Although it provided for specific measures to ameliorate pollutant levels and to prevent undue human exposure, it did not specifically define “public health emergency,” specify duration, or provide for long-term systemic changes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        While the ongoing crisis in Delhi was born of the externalities of rapid urban and economic development in the context of a shifting climate, it has been abetted by profound failure in political will and coordination within a federal system of divided responsibilities ill-suited to regulating air pollutants. Against this murky backdrop of failed public health and environmental governance, the EPCA has proven to be a bright beacon shining amidst the fog.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">EPCA's Declaration</h2>

                                    <p>
                                    
                                        In response to Delhi’s decades-long escalation in air pollution levels, the EPCA was constituted in 1998 pursuant to an India Supreme Court order for preventing excess ambient air pollution in the city. Its recent November 2019 declaration came after a 48-hour period of levels exceeding the most severe tier in the Air Quality Index: five times the standard considered acceptable in India and nearly ten times the standard deemed safe by the WHO.

The EPCA used the November declaration to set out a brief factual summary attributing the high PM levels to firecracker use, stubble burning, and adverse weather. Accompanying the declaration, the EPCA advised schools to minimise outdoor activity and specifically required all construction activities in the city to cease for a week. It also put a temporary stop on certain forms of dirty industry operations and prohibited all firecracker use. All this, came after the EPCA’s earlier declaration in October that provided for a raft of other measures in Delhi and set out a strongly worded demand that Punjab and Haryana states curb stubble burning.

                                    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Nepotism on bollywood:</span> <h1>What is special about the movie Tumbbad?</h1><p> Most of the Bollywood horror movies you watch are either a copy of the Hollywood horror franchise or its narration is similar to Hollywood. Tumbbad is different, it has its own unique style which is completely new to Indian cinema. With its impressive visuals, realistic atmosphere, and a breathtaking score, Tumbbad attracts you into its world of fantasy just like a magnet. Now let us read some facts about the film:

                                        The movie was shot in the rain at age-old locations in 2012 but after the editing, Anil Barve (director) and Sohum Shah (main lead) weren't satisfied with it. They were not able to achieve what it set out to do. It was then re-written and re-shot and the filming was completed in May 2015.</p>
                                        <p></p>
                                        <img src="tub2.jpg" class="img-fluid shadow">
                                    <p>
                                        The movie was shot for 6 years. The scenes shown in the city of Tumbbad which gets rain throughout the year was shot over 4 monsoons. That's why the rain in the movie looks so real and gives you the “wet” feel all the time.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another special thing about this movie is its lighting. The movie was shot in natural lighting; 50 lanterns and lamps were used for several scenes to avoid modern-day lighting techniques since it was a period film.
                                        Most of the shooting locations of the film are real and were shot in real villages and landscapes without modern infringements, without towers and structures. The art designing of this movie is just brilliant.
                                    </p>
                                    <img src="tumb3.jpg " class ="img-fluid shadow">
                                    <p>    The film's post-production took two-and-a-half years to complete.
                                        The film's climax inside the womb was shot with only one source of light - an oil lamp.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Now you know how much hard work went into making this film and how it is different from other Indian movies. Each and every aspect of the movie has been handled carefully. The main theme(which most of the Indian horror movies lack) is based on greed. This movie is a great example that a horror/fantasy movie isn't only about monsters, creatures, or ghosts. As Guillermo del Toro once said, “The scariest things in my stories, in my opinion, are the humans”.

Another great thing about Tumbbad is its music. Each of the three parts of the movie has a distinct sound created stunningly by Jesper Kyd, a Danish composer.

Next time if you watch this movie, observe these things carefully and you will understand why this film is so special.
